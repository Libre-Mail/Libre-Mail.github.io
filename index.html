<h1>Request a service</h1>
<p>Do you want an email account or to host your custom domain for email with Libre-Mail?</p>
<p>Libre-Mail is a collective that recognizes and promotes <strong>anticapitalism</strong>, <strong>antiracism</strong>, <strong>antifascism</strong>, <strong>antisexism</strong>, <strong>antimilitarism</strong>, and the <strong>refusal of authoritarianism and hierarchies</strong>. We all work on this project on a volunteer basis. If we do it, it’s because we firmly believe in these principles, and the people we want to offer these services to are the people who share these principles. Tell us the reasons why you share these principles and what kind of person you are. You don’t have to detail your private life - we just need to get an idea of why we should offer a service to you.</p>
<p>Every request will be read by a real person, not by a robot. So we will appreciate every piece of information you decide to share with us, and hope we can establish a trust relationship, starting from the fact that your request will eventually be destroyed.</p>
<p>But trust is mutual: just as we will believe in what you say without asking for your personal data, if we see that you’re violating our principles publicly while using our services, we won’t hesitate to delete your account without previous notice. If you want to use our services, make sure this is the right place for you.</p>
<p>We hope that you use the technology and communication tools we are offering you mindfully, and that besides this you are also ready to claim, <em>in real life</em>, your freedom of expression and communication.</p>
